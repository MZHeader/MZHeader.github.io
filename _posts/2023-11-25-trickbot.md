A financial Trojan believed to be a derivative of Dyre: the bot uses very similar code, web injects, and operational tactics. Has multiple modules including VNC and Socks5 Proxy. Uses SSL for C2 communication.
The WIZARD SPIDER threat group is the Russia-based operator of the TrickBot banking malware.
