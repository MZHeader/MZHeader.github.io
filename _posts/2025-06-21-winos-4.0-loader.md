## Winos 4.0 Loader - sRDI Shellcode Analysis

Placeholder

Analysis starts with a NSIS installer binary called ToDesk_Setup_4.7.6.3.exe (86758fb6c5aa0093741402302a0478dab94992ff5c8426f2bc24c815cdeec08c).
This is a trojanised installer file which writes the legitimate application to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Application", as well as a series of shellcode loaders and shellcode executors in "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local" and "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\TrustAsia".

insttect.exe (ecd6742f5107215ed10fb7aebca3c35190e9a2a4022dc019f863abdcdd530fa9) - This is our first shellcode loader, which gets executed from the AppData\Local directory.

Setting a breakpoint at CreateFileA calls we can see that the binary creates a handle to Single.ini, which was written to the same directory.

Following along until the next VirtualAlloc call, we can see in the ESI / EDI registers that there is a PE file in memory:

We could dump this executable from memory, alternatively, we can use a tool like Binary Refinery to carve the PE from the Single.ini file:

```
ef Single.ini | carve-pe | peek
```

```
ef Single.ini | carve-pe | dump C:\Users\DFIR\Desktop\carved-dll.dll
```

Continuing with debugging we can see that the DLL is called with the VFPower export.

Reference to 360Tray.exe

Analysis of this first shellcode loader reveals that the executed DLL has functionality to monitor for 360tray.exe and 360safe.exe processes with the use of the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Windows API.
