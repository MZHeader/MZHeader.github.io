## **Unbelievable | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
Don't believe everything you see on the Internet!

Anyway, have you heard this intro soundtrack from Half-Life 3?

Challenge files:
Half-Life_3_OST.mp3 - 0f33ec86710e901eceb6894c96eaab8d88be66f859a4338186e2225a855dcd27



Solution
Verify if the .mp3 file is actually what it claims to be using the file command
```
file Half-Life_3_OST.mp3
```
You see that it is a .png file, so rename it and open it to find the flag as text in the image file
Use an OCR tool/ text extractor to get your flag
```
tesseract file.png flag
```

## **TXT Message | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
Hmmm, have you seen some of the strange DNS records for the ctf.games domain? One of them sure is odd... 



Solution
Given the challenge name, we need to look for the TXT record for ctf.games
dig TXT ctf.games
```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
ctf.games.              14400   IN      TXT     "146 154 141 147 173 061 064 145 060 067 062 146 067 060 065 144 064 065 070 070 062 064 060 061 144 061 064 061 143 065 066 062 146 144 143 060 142 175"
```

We see an interesting TXT record. Looking at the description we see that od is slanted... there is a Linux command od short for octal dump
Simply decode the octal dump

31337 Linux cmdline method : 
```
printf '\146\154\141\147\173\061\064\145\060\067\062\146\067\060\065\144\064\065\070\070\062\064\060\061\144\061\064\061\143\065\066\062\146\144\143\060\142\175'
```
```
octal_values = [
    146, 154, 141, 147, 173, 61, 64, 145, 60, 67, 62, 146, 67, 60, 65, 144, 64, 65, 70, 
    70, 62, 64, 60, 61, 144, 61, 64, 61, 143, 65, 66, 62, 146, 144, 143, 60, 142, 175
]

# Convert octal values to ASCII characters
decoded = ''.join([chr(int(str(num), 8)) for num in octal_values])
print(ascii_chars_from_octal)
```

## **Whamazon | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
Wham! Bam! Amazon is entering the hacking business! Can you buy a flag?


Solution
Start the web instance and interact with the web based command line

Trying to buy a flag shows you don't have enough money

Try buy an apple or something else instead and buy a negative value of it

Infinite money glitch

Now buy the flag

Beat the rock paper scissors by choosing scissors (the shop always chooses paper)

Check inventory for the flag

Solution
Read the file cattle

Notice it has "moo" repeated in  different variations and cases

Google moo cipher and find that cow cipher is being used

Decode the cow cipher

## **MatryoshkaQR | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
Wow! This is a big QR code! I wonder what it says...?

Challenge files:
qrcode.png - 9dc337224caa057f0f3eb1134defd2c291a295f861a777101b3eb4987b554c0c



Solution
Get the data from the QR code image using a command like:
```

## **Zulu | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
Did you know that zulu is part of the phonetic alphabet?

Challenge files:
Zulu - a1385a40dd63729ed733673e925a62f583eb1b795b90193678bd5899bce77c8ae



Solution
Use the file command to determine that zulu is a compressed archive

Use 7zip to extract the file zulu\~ from the archive; this file contains the flag

## **Unbelievable | Warmups 🏃‍♂️ | @JohnHammond**
You gotta make sure the people who find stuff for you are rewarded well!

Escalate your privileges and uncover the flag.txt in the finder user's home directory.



Solution
Start  and connect to the service

Use the find command chained with grep to get the flag
```
find /home/ -type f -exec grep -E 'flag\{[0-9a-f]{32}' {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

## **GoCrackMe1 | Reverse Engineering 🔃 | @HuskyHacks**
TENNNNNN-HUT!

Welcome to the Go Dojo, gophers in training!

Go malware is on the rise. So we need you to sharpen up those Go reverse engineering skills. We've written three simple CrackMe programs in Go to turn you into Go-binary reverse engineering ninjas!

First up is the easiest of the three. Go get em!

Challenge File:
GoCrackMe1.zip - 5460DF1F9A9708343C7F47FC91AC793C094F0C723C91CFACF3995BAC385891FB (Archive Password: infected)

Solution:
Execute the binary, we received "Access Denied!"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/202077cd-6f8c-4fda-8679-f947f47d7f9e)

Load into a disassembler and locate main_main function

Follow the execution flow and note that there's a conditional jump, one set of instructions is to print the string "Access Denied!" so it's very likely that we want to reverse the jump to execute the other instructions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c576ea0f-6f27-4972-b98e-ce92eb447e50)

Load the program into cutter in write mode and reverse the jump. Edit > Reverse Jump

Execute the modified program and receive the flag

## **GoCrackMe2| Reverse Engineering 🔃 | @HuskyHacks**
Not bad gophers, but that one was the easiest of the three! How will you do against something a little more involved? I wouldn't expect to get any help from debugging symbols on this one...

Challenge File:
GoCrackMe2.zip - 3AB041E5D7825F0E963EA7DDBC938EFCF33C2F7E082C109358FF268FCF6FF538

Solution (WIP)
JBE Instruction at 0x004881a3 - Patch this from JBE (0f 86) to JA (0f 87)

This takes us to a different loop which prints the second half of the flag rather than the first half


## **GoCrackMe3| Reverse Engineering 🔃 | @HuskyHacks**
You've trained, you've failed, you've succeeded, you've learned. Everything you've done up to this point has prepared you for this moment. Don't let me down, Gopher. Don't let me down.

Challenge File:
GoCrackMe3.zip - FBFEC8DD944FE9A5A839B49569EC6D0CD3EA34BAA7F6128C1E501F4321978E98 (Archive Password: infected)

Solution
Using EDB debugger, step through the program and follow the execution flow, stepping over everything, eventually the progrm will exit with the message "Access Denied!"
Re-open the program and locate and step through the different functions responsible for this "Access Denied!" Message, this will take you through the following addresses/ functions:
```
0x43229b > Points to 0x4f7a00 > Calls 0x4e5340 > 0x4e53ad Calls RSI > 0x4dd1c0 > 0x4d7c00 > 0x4d8120 > 0x403300
```

Continue to step through until you reach the conditional jump instruction at 0x4f7a76

This instruction will jump to 0x4f7cbe if our Zero Flag is set to 1 from the previous Test al, al instruction, in our case, it is 1, if we change nothing and continue to step through, the program will exit with Access Denied!

We can also note the Access Denied ASCII strings present in some register values

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f30442e7-8a57-4f61-92cc-9d72144f8273)

Load the program back up and set a breakpoint at 0x4f7a76, this time, we're going to reverse the jump by changing our Zero Flag from 1 to 0, now we'll step over to the next instruction at 0x4f7a7c

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cb52fad-0692-49a9-9f52-078346402b7c)

In EDB, change the Zero Flag by double clicking the Z under the registers view

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab9c4c3a-4ea5-44cc-9f50-49d49633245b)

Keep stepping through, at 0x4f7dc9 we're going to hit an instruction that jumps us to 0x4f81ab

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce0540a5-5455-4766-bf1d-08053a3c157b)

This initiates a loop between 0x4f819e and 0x4f81ae

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909771ba-a0d1-401d-96db-6ae1383e8bf2)

We'll toggle a breakpoint at the following instruction 0x4f81b0 which we'll hit when the loop completes 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d3a9b8-de10-4231-bfd8-fedbb9b0f422)

Reviewing the RAX register we can see a string which could indicate part of the flag is being written

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/345ba46b-1967-4dd3-940d-c5b4e3fb8fe2)

We step through the program and keep re-iterating the same loop for further bytes to be written to R12, including a flag{ string, a strong indication that this is our flag being written
Eventually, if we keep stepping through, the program will exit and we will receive "Access Still Denied!", the R12 register will look like so at this point, we are still missing some characters for the flag:
(In some cases the program terminates only after the first part is written)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84f1c5f-b2fa-49ef-bfc6-9605865d754d)

Debug the program again and do the same thing, pay attention to the instructions after the loop completes: It jumps to 0x4f7dce, performs a Test Al, Al at 0x4f7d80 followed by a conditional jump (JE to 0x4f7e45) at 0x4f7d82
If our Zero Flag is 1 at this point, we hit this jump to 0x4f7e45  which will terminate the program
We need to ensure that our Zero Flag is set to 0 at this instruction to be taken back to the loop, so this is another good place to set a breakpoint and ensure the ZF is 0

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06aa1f16-c0b6-4c2f-a4e8-c5827cd56abb)

After changing our ZF and returning the loop, the entire flag will be written and visible in the R12 register

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65ea1241-4d65-41ca-be1c-77b01251719f)

Now it's just a case of stepping through, we'll hit another loop and see that the flag will start to be written in the R12 register in the correct order

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd5db46-9ee5-470c-91c7-474fa9e3053e)

After completing the loops a few times, we'll see the full flag

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69f5a9e0-42ad-4c57-b346-c271717fb440)

If you go too far, the program will exit with "Actually, I don't feel like printing the flag... But I can tell you that the flag is 38 characters long."


## **OceanLocust | Reverse Engineering 🔐 | @aenygma**
A simple message for you to decipher:

squiqhyiiycfbudeduutvehrhkjki

Submit the original plaintext hashed with MD5, wrapped between the usual flag format: flag{}

Ex: If the deciphered text is "hello world", the MD5 hash would be 5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3, and the flag would be flag{5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3}.


Solution
Brutus suggests that Ceaser Cipher (ROT cipher) is being used

List out all of the ROT13 possibilities squiqhyiiycfbudeduutvehrhkjki and find the answer caesarissimplenoneedforbrutus (ROT10)

**Part 1**

The first question is:

What is the IP address of the host that the attacker used?

NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

Author: Austin Worline, Jose Oregon, and Adrian Garcia

The Security and System event logs contain legitimate data, the Application event logs appear to be empty.

Solution:
- Use evtxecmd to process the system and security event logs.
- Search for 4624/4625 events which show the Source endpoint as Kali (10.1.1.42)

Flag: 10.1.1.42
 
**Part 2**

How many times was the compromised account brute-forced? Answer just the integer value.

NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

Author: Austin Worline, Jose Oregon, and Adrian Garcia

Solution:
- Use evtxecmd to process the system and security event logs.
- Search for logon failed events (4625) for jsmith. 32 events are shown 

Flag: 32

**Part 3**

What is the name of the offensive security tool that was used to gain initial access? Answer in all lowercase.

NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

Author: Austin Worline, Jose Oregon, and Adrian Garcia

Solution:
- Use evtxecmd to process the system and security event logs.

- The logons to the host were type 3 logons, indicaitng a suite such as Impacket was used to achieve command execution

- Following the logon event for jsmith, we can see process creation events (4688) for the following:
- - C:\Windows\wgWMRHln.exe
- - C:\Windows\qebXSwGD.exe
- - C:\Windows\MrEQbpfX.exe

- The process creation events indicate the binary was executed as SYSTEM 

- Reviewing the System logs, we can see service creation events (7045) for the above binaries with random 4 letter names (fdpa/WREx)

These behaviours are consistent with the use of Impacket PSExec

(In reality just guess psexec and win)

Flag: psexec

**Part 4**

How many unique enumeration commands were run with net.exe? Answer just the integer value.

NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

Author: Austin Worline, Jose Oregon, and Adrian Garcia

Solution:
- Use evtxecmd to process the system and security event logs.

- Search for Process Creation (4688) events with the Executable net.exe
- Count the enumeration commands
- - net user
- - net localgroup
- - net share

Flag: 3

**Part 5**

What password was successfully given to the user created?

NOTE: Flags for Part #1 to Part #5 will all be human-readable answers and in a non-standard flag format. You will use the same downloadable attachment and log files to answer all the questions.

Solution:

- Use evtxecmd to process the system and security event logs.

- Search for User Creation (4720) events

- Review the Process Creation (4688) events prior to the 4720 event, we can see a net.exe process with the following command line:

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\net.exe "C:\Windows\system32\net.exe" user susan_admin Susan123! /ADD

Flag: Susan123!

c is converted to a MemoryStream, after AES decryption using k as the key and i as the IV

Copy the c variable as the input, Use a From Base64 operating, then an AES decrypt operation with the k variable as the key and i for the IV

## **Strange Calc | Malware 👾 | @JohnHammond**

I got this new calculator app from my friend! But it's really weird, for some reason it needs admin permissions to run??

NOTE: Archive password is strange_calc

Challenge File:
calc.zip - 4c95f07e2269b31bbc3b577ac37a9f1e5890d475076eac2402b4bd0d2b834b78

Solution:
-Extract AutoIT Script
-Convert $a from Base64 and Microsoft Script Decoder
-Add console.log to various lines through the script and run through a browser console to debug and view contents

Solution Script:
```
function a(b) {
    var c = "", d = b.split("\n");
    console.log("Split lines:", d);
    for (var e = 0; e < d.length; e++) {
        var f = d[e].replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
        console.log("Processed line:", f);
        if (f.indexOf("begin") === 0 || f.indexOf("end") === 0 || f === "") continue;
        var g = (f.charCodeAt(0) - 32) & 63;
        console.log("g value:", g);
        for (var h = 1; h < f.length; h += 4) {
            if (h + 3 >= f.length) break;
            var i = (f.charCodeAt(h) - 32) & 63,
                j = (f.charCodeAt(h + 1) - 32) & 63,
                k = (f.charCodeAt(h + 2) - 32) & 63,
                l = (f.charCodeAt(h + 3) - 32) & 63;
            console.log("i, j, k, l values:", i, j, k, l);
            c += String.fromCharCode((i << 2) | (j >> 4));
            console.log("Intermediate c value after first char:", c);
            if (h + 2 < f.length - 1) {
                c += String.fromCharCode(((j & 15) << 4) | (k >> 2));
                console.log("Intermediate c value after second char:", c);
            }
            if (h + 3 < f.length - 1) {
                c += String.fromCharCode(((k & 3) << 6) | l);
                console.log("Intermediate c value after third char:", c);
            }
        }
    }
    console.log("Final c value before substring:", c);
    return c
}

var m = "begin 644 -\nG9FQA9WLY.3(R9F(R,6%A9C$W-3=E,V9D8C(X9#<X.3!A-60Y,WT*\n`\nend";
var n = a(m);
console.log("Decoded string:", n);

## **Red Phish Blue Phish! | Misc ❓ | @truman.huntress, @adam.huntress**

You are to conduct a phishing excercise against our client, Pyrch Data.

We've identified the Marketing Director, Sarah Williams (swilliams@pyrchdata.com), as a user susceptible to phishing.

Are you able to successfully phish her? Remember your OSINT 😉

NOTE: The port that becomes accessible upon challenge deployment is an SMTP server. Please use this for sending any phishing emails.

You will not receive an email/human response as the mail infrastructure for this challenge is emulated.

This challenge had a web interface to start



Solution
Connect to the provided SMTP server using telnet

Do a bit of OSINT on pyrch to see the company website  (pyrchdata.com) and see that the security officer is called Joe Davern

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/479e3b8b-8105-439c-89b9-77b87454730f)

Using what we know, craft a phishing email pretending to be the IT Security Manager

We know the email format is firstname_firstletter + surname@pyrchdata.com because Sarah Williams (swilliams@pyrchdata.com)

Pretend to be jdaveren@pyrchdata.com (the subjects and contents don't really matter, but have fun crafting your phishing email

## **Base64by32 | Scripting 📜 | @JohnHammond**

This is a dumb challenge. I'm sorry. 

Challenge files:
base64by32.zip - cef862a3606afc9ba862986f0fb28cbad0346fa8f4b8ccc76b7d339c141fb2bb



Solution
Unzip the archive base64by32.zip

The challenge title tells you what to do... base64 decode the file 32 times

Solution Script:
```
#!/bin/bash

encoded_string=$(cat base64by32)

decode_base64() {
    echo "$1" | base64 -d
}

for ((i=1; i<=32; i++)); do
    encoded_string=$(decode_base64 "$encoded_string")
    #echo  "Decoded $i times: $encoded_string"
done

echo "Decoded 32 times: $encoded_string"
```
