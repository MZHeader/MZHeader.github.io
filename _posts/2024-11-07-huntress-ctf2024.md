Don't believe everything you see on the Internet!

Anyway, have you heard this intro soundtrack from Half-Life 3?

Challenge files:
Half-Life_3_OST.mp3 - 0f33ec86710e901eceb6894c96eaab8d88be66f859a4338186e2225a855dcd27



Solution
Verify if the .mp3 file is actually what it claims to be using the file command
```
file Half-Life_3_OST.mp3
```
You see that it is a .png file, so rename it and open it to find the flag as text in the image file
Use an OCR tool/ text extractor to get your flag
```
tesseract file.png flag
```

Hmmm, have you seen some of the strange DNS records for the ctf.games domain? One of them sure is odd... 



Solution
Given the challenge name, we need to look for the TXT record for ctf.games
dig TXT ctf.games
```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
ctf.games.              14400   IN      TXT     "146 154 141 147 173 061 064 145 060 067 062 146 067 060 065 144 064 065 070 070 062 064 060 061 144 061 064 061 143 065 066 062 146 144 143 060 142 175"
```

We see an interesting TXT record. Looking at the description we see that od is slanted... there is a Linux command od short for octal dump
Simply decode the octal dump

31337 Linux cmdline method : 
```
printf '\146\154\141\147\173\061\064\145\060\067\062\146\067\060\065\144\064\065\070\070\062\064\060\061\144\061\064\061\143\065\066\062\146\144\143\060\142\175'
```
```
octal_values = [
    146, 154, 141, 147, 173, 61, 64, 145, 60, 67, 62, 146, 67, 60, 65, 144, 64, 65, 70, 
    70, 62, 64, 60, 61, 144, 61, 64, 61, 143, 65, 66, 62, 146, 144, 143, 60, 142, 175
]

# Convert octal values to ASCII characters
decoded = ''.join([chr(int(str(num), 8)) for num in octal_values])
print(ascii_chars_from_octal)
```

Wham! Bam! Amazon is entering the hacking business! Can you buy a flag?


Solution
Start the web instance and interact with the web based command line
Trying to buy a flag shows you don't have enough money
Try buy an apple or something else instead and buy a negative value of it
Infinite money glitch
Now buy the flag
Beat the rock paper scissors by choosing scissors (the shop always chooses paper)
Check inventory for the flag
