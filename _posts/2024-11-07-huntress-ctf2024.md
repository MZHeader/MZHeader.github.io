Don't believe everything you see on the Internet!

Anyway, have you heard this intro soundtrack from Half-Life 3?

Challenge files:
Half-Life_3_OST.mp3 - 0f33ec86710e901eceb6894c96eaab8d88be66f859a4338186e2225a855dcd27



Solution
Verify if the .mp3 file is actually what it claims to be using the file command
```
file Half-Life_3_OST.mp3
```
You see that it is a .png file, so rename it and open it to find the flag as text in the image file
Use an OCR tool/ text extractor to get your flag
```
tesseract file.png flag
```
